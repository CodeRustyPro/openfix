1. Use temperature 0.0 for all code generation.
2. Explicitly forbid markdown formatting (```diff) in output instructions.
3. Include "CANNOT_FIX_SAFELY" as the only allowed failure escape hatch.
4. Keep context chunks concise; prefer high precision retrieval over large context windows.
5. Always include file paths in diff headers (a/file b/file).
6. Max tokens for generation should be sufficient for the patch (e.g. 2048 or 4096).
